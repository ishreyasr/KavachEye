<p><strong>Women Safety Analytics</strong> is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and visualizing key factors affecting women's safety. The project leverages machine learning and data analytics techniques to extract meaningful insights from crime and safety-related datasets, enabling better understanding and awareness of women's safety issues.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: In-depth exploration of datasets related to women's safety.</li><li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Intuitive and impactful visualizations for better understanding of patterns and trends.</li><li><strong>Machine Learning Models</strong>: Predictive analysis to identify high-risk areas or situations.</li><li><strong>Interactive Dashboards</strong>: Engaging tools to help users interact with the data insights.</li></ul>
<br></br>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<ul><li>To identify trends in women's safety-related data.</li><li>To assist policymakers, law enforcement, and NGOs in understanding and addressing safety concerns.</li></ul>

<h4>Models Used:</h4>
<ol><li><p><strong>Gender Classification Model</strong>: This model distinguishes between male and female individuals in real-time video feeds, enabling the system to monitor and analyze gender distribution in public areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Violence Detection Model</strong>: Trained to recognize violent behaviors or actions, this model analyzes live surveillance footage to detect potential threats, facilitating prompt intervention.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pose Estimation Model</strong>: This model assesses human body postures to identify distress signals or unusual movements that may indicate a person in danger, enhancing the system's ability to detect and respond to emergencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facial Emotion Recognition Model</strong>: By analyzing facial expressions, this model detects emotions such as fear or distress, providing additional context to assess potential safety threats.</p></li></ol>

<h3>Workflow of the Women Safety Analytics System ðŸš¦</h3>
<ol><li><p><strong>Data Input</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video Feed/Surveillance Data</strong>: The system processes real-time video streams from public or private surveillance cameras.</li><li><strong>Image Data</strong>: Still images are used for specific analysis tasks.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Preprocessing</strong></p><ul><li>Frames are extracted from video streams for further processing.</li><li>Images are resized, normalized, and augmented (if necessary) to improve model performance.</li><li>Background noise and irrelevant data are filtered out.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Model 1: Gender Classification</strong></p><ul><li>The first step identifies the gender of individuals in the scene.</li><li>Helps determine if more women are present in specific areas for focused monitoring.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Model 2: Pose Estimation</strong></p><ul><li>Analyzes the posture of individuals in the frame.</li><li>Detects suspicious or distress-related body movements (e.g., a person falling or showing signs of struggle).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Model 3: Facial Emotion Recognition</strong></p><ul><li>Evaluates facial expressions to detect fear, distress, or other concerning emotions.</li><li>Assigns risk scores based on detected emotions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Model 4: Violence Detection</strong></p><ul><li>Scans the environment for violent actions or sudden aggressive movements.</li><li>Triggers alerts if violence is detected in the monitored area.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Integration and Decision Making</strong></p><ul><li>Outputs from all models are aggregated and analyzed.</li><li>A safety risk score is calculated for the monitored area.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Alerts and Reporting</strong></p><ul><li>If the risk score crosses a predefined threshold:<ul><li>An alert is sent to authorities or security personnel.</li><li>The exact location and a snapshot of the event are highlighted.</li></ul></li><li>Generates logs and reports for further analysis.</li><li>Includes visualizations of gender distribution, risk zones, and detected events.</li></ul></li></ol>
